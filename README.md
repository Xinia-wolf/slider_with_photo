Slider for a site by layout. This is a stand-alone part that can be later implemented into a production site.

The appearance of the site has been transformed so that images and information about the object change.

The slider contains the following control elements:
1. Arrows - switch slides in a ring. That is, after slide No. 3, slide No. 1 will open again.
2. Circles between the arrows - turn on the desired slide.
3. Links above the slider - include the desired slide.
